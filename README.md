# HactoberFest23

HactoberFest23 is a month-long celebration of open source software. During October, developers from all over the world are encouraged to contribute to open source projects by making four pull requests. This event is a great way to get involved in the open source community and learn new skills.

The HactoberFest23 GitHub repository is a central hub for all things related to the event. Here, you can find information on how to participate, as well as a list of participating projects. You can also connect with other developers and get help with making your first pull request.
